				<p>We wear the mask that grins and lies,<br>It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes."<br>- Paul Laurence Dunbar</p>
				<p>While it's commonly accepted that we all wear masks in order to orchestrate a performance for others, performing for long periods of time has its consequences. It can become dehumanizing, derealizing, and depersonalizing. The mask can become harmful if abused and instead impede a human.</p>
				<p>After three or more years of hiding myself away in an overly understanding friend's home, I've come to the realization that my 'inadequacies' and 'failures' are the result of none other than myself putting up a facade and various walls around me. It doesn't come as a surprise, as I've long been well informed by others that I'm an awkward individual, one who 'suffers' from high-functioning autism or what use to be commonly known as Asperger's Syndrome. With that knowledge deeply ingrained within the frontal lobe of my brain I've constructed a mental image of myself in the form of a monster. The social anxiety I experience when being in almost any form of communication with a single or multiple human(s) is enough to have shaped my responses and actions in a very disconcerting manner.</p>
				<p>I've distanced myself from everyone possible. If I can I won't communicate with others in a effort to escape notice. It's not that </p>

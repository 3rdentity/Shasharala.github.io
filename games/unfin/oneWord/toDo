Setting a time limit in the form of a periodically resetting "captcha" may further raise the difficulty.

- caps lock warning
- hilight rules not being followed when incorrect
- music?
- onkeyup events to track current state of "pwd"?

playtesting results:
- add easter eggs?
- change "w0rd5" to something more meaningful
- copyright info?
- players are having trouble realizing that they do not need an account to play, it's a "trick". make this more obvious
- sort emails by "date" or something
- some players do not realize that session expired is the "end" of the game
- some users do not notice that a "lowercase word" is requried on stupid question
- ie11 display issue? "reset pass" prompt is "off-screen" - toolbars may be pushing content down. test height of screen?
- if user resizes screen issues
- players state that it IS amusing
- no confirm buttons (enter/return buttons are supposed to be used but are nothinted at)
the word "symbols" may not be a well understood term. offer some examples. "use symbols like '%, &, ^, etc'"

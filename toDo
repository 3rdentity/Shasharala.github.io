- make a blow up everything button/key
- add old blog posts in a trash/locked bin of some sort
- consider better meta settings for css. throwing window to the side of screen on smaller screens makes some things not fit properly
- make website work on phones?
- site's layout breaks just slightly when windows get particularly skinny
- 404.gif is missing noticeable frames and needs to be fixed. curses!
- general cleanup bad tabbing and inline CSS is not nice stuff

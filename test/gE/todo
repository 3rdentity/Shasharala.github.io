- rename physics to math and implement various maths
- rename entities to assets and prepare it for loading multiple types of assets
- add dom.js with var. functions to manipulate dom. make sure to use said functions in rest of code ( is this necessary? will it slow things down as it hunts for what you're trying to do with DOM? Would it be any slower than jQuery?)
- consider merging options/player(controls?)/entities(maps, etc.) into one assets.js
- ability to edit controls in-game? way to add "controls"/eventListeners easily when designing
- various comments in files denote things that need to be done
- clipping
- AI
- idle/attack animations + dmg vals/reactions (this will involve death/spawning handling)
- backgrounds/scenery?
- fullscreen canvas/full window canvas
- browser sniffing/fallback if browser is incompatible
- type detection

- fix collision
- z-index of sprites
- viewport should be seperate from level/map allowing a scrolling/moving viewport
- make sure that calls to "game" are actually calling "Engine.game" and not "game"
- come up with an idea for a sidescrolling game
- this game needs a name
- sprites for the game
- refactor anon func's to be: thisIsWhereAnonFuncIsLocated_nameOfFunc
- browser sniffing/fallback if browser is incompatible
- cleanup animation code a tad and consider sperating it into its own lib


- ORDER THESE BY ORDER OF IMPORTANCE AND THEN START THE WORK!

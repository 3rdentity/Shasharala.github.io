- make sure that website appears appropriatly on tablets/phones
- new favicon? :p is boring
- fiddle with wording on 404 page and make 404 cat's gameboy have speaker/flashing screen with "404" on it
- consider overhauling color scheme and display, particularly for blog
- filler art on short pages?
- consider an opt-in to cookies button? (though, consider further, wouldn't it be similar to opt-inning to use Javascript? kinda silly, no?)
- consider a "turn on cookies for a good user experience page w/ instructions to turn them on"?
- put fonts into a folder with website and set fonts to px not general sizes

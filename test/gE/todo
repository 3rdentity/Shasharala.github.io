- ability to edit controls in-game? way to add "controls"/eventListeners easily when designing
- various comments in files denote things that need to be done
- clipping
- AI
- idle/attack animations + dmg vals/reactions (this will involve death/spawning handling)
- backgrounds/scenery?
- browser sniffing/fallback if browser is incompatible

QUICK & IMMEDIATE TODO:
- finish working on dom.js and math.js
- make a fsm
- add collision/clipping
- so on and so forth

?DID I SEE LINK LAG AFTER THE GAME HAD BEEN OPEN FOR HOURS?

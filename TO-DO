- make sure that website appears appropriatly on tablets/consider making computer resolutions more responsive ( AKA consider changing width from 'px' to '%' this may save on over-complicating things with @media)
- add monster to website/find a way to present it
- come up with way to present games on games.html
- finish personal license by combining cc by-nc 4.0 and aferro gpl license
- meta, beta, theta, delta tags?
- edit 404
- change highlight color
- consider making 'blog posts' seperate from other 'posts' with a different class name. mostly so that pages that are not /blog will be a familiar size ( AKA create a specific content/container for index instead of using content mainly meant for blog?)
- fix each page using 'welcome' instead of their own class - related to 'blog posts' seperate from 'posts' issue
- consider making navigation with capital letters and centered. possibly bold?
- change .a color
- edit about to be a tad more presentable?
- re-size images for license to be 25%. do not forget to put images in a div to make them resize more appropriately when accessing the website from different machines. give deep consideration to @media
- consider an hr before banner or after banner

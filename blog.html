			<!--AN ODD SERIES OF EVENTS -- 03/19/2014-->
			<!--<div class="post">
					<span="title">an odd series of events</span><br><span class="titleTime">03/19/2014</span><hr>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						i was thinking about the way choices are handled in anna anthropy's <i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">queers in love at the end of the world</i></a> and many games do not employ a time limit on the choices that a player makes, making the choices often seem arbitrary.

			<!--A QUEER END -- 03/18/2014-->
			<div class="post">
						<span class="title">a queer end</span><br><span class="titleTime">03/18/2014</span><hr>
				<div class="content">

					<p>
						if you have not yet played anna anthropy's <i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">queers in love at the end of the world</i></a>, then i suggest you do so now before continuing to read. play it a few times, as only so much can be gleaned from quick, ten-second intervals of gameplay. certainly, playing it once will be intriguing enough to keep you enthralled for a few fast-paced moments as you try to make the 'end of the world' worth something. if playing a quick game that will take up ten seconds of your time and offer an interesting perspective on decision-making does not interest you then please read on. before you do, though, please consider that even glancing at all these jumbled words will take longer than simply playing the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						in short, <i>queers in love at the end of the world</i> appears simple but manages to encapsulate the essence of being in love in a manner that many longer, more drawn out games will fail to deliver. each action and choice has much more weight to it by forcing the player to make multiple decisions within a time limit. you may find yourself playing the game multiple times, quickly spending more than a mere ten seconds trying to comprehend not only the deeply emotional sentences that appear on the screen with each frantic click, but the emptiness those sentences will incite when the end arrives.
					</p>
					<p>
						before things fall apart and fade from the screen, each tastefully revealing click is entirely dependent on where the player wants to go and what they want to accomplish. i found myself quickly scanning, breathing the words as my partner waited for me to acknowledge them in a way that will not actually mean anything when everything is wiped away. which is an odd feeling, since the relationship isn't actually defined. there are very few specific details about the relationship that you share with this significant other but, by keeping specifics to a minimum and employing a text-only tale the player is able to better imagine their interpretation of a loved one.
					</p>
					<p>
						the game plays heartwrenchingly well, reminding me of past relationships that have since gone sour despite my doing my almost utmost to keep them going well. no matter what choices you make, though, it will all come to an abrupt end in a fairly quick and almost quiet manner. the game is sad in the way that it makes each moment more tangible than the last in a desperate attempt to make some action be noteworthy. it raises interesting questions about the worth of one's actions. by making each choice such an important factor to the mere ten seconds you have to play, each decision has a particular weight and complexity that is rendered useless shortly thereafter. it is a very interesting concept i would love to see explored more deeply and more often.
					</p>
					<p>
						at this point, if i have not yet convinced you to at least try <i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">queers in love at the end of the world</i></a> then i could resort to begging. please try it. preferably alone, comfortably, with a cup of wine and a morbid mood. you will not regret it.

						having just barely finished what could be described as a webpage i am delighted to find that i now have a space to post my various thoughts and ramblings. they occur at irregular intervals, inviting intensive thinking and keeping me throughly distracted from things others may consider more important. i expect much of the content i spatter across this area will be wrought heavily with criticism and wonder.

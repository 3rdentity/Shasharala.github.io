              &nbsp;&nbsp;"What am I?" This is the tough question I find myself muttering under my breath most often. This one questions leads to dozens more, of course. Thoughts like "Where am I?", "What is it I am doing?", and "How will my current actions affect my future choices and options?" permeate my brain, distracting me. It is something I have gotten use to but that when I have the time to focus on I find myself concerned about. I spend too much time on worrying and not enough time on acting.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Anxious, fearful, shamed... these are things I do not want to be but continually find myself engrossed in. "I'm not good enough" or "There must be more I can do", I fret to myself with no real answer as to how to produce more or how to be "better". Which seems to be the underlying problem anyway. "What do I want to be?". I do not have a good answer. Not yet. So I while away my hours thinking about what I find "fun", what I find "fascinating" and how I can go about doing more of those things while still maintaining my personal livelihood.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, designing things tends to be something I enjoy and it appears that humans tend to enjoy consuming things created by other humans! So I tell myself that if I simply study hard, focus more, and commit myself that I will be able to do what I love and be able to continue eating processed noodles with little packets of flavored sodium. I find myself only temporarily content with this logic before I worry about what consuming only cheap noodle-based products will do to this vessel I find myself encased in. From there I start to concern myself with the continued use of the four walls and roof that currently surround me. Which cascades into a series of vexations each worse than the last.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;It is a form of paralysis. Unable to make a choice because I'm so indecisive I jump from thought to thought, project to project, scenario to eating to sleeping to fretting some more. "What am I?". I am a troubled creature with no particularly serious maladies besides the few in its mind. As far as I can tell I am a human and as a human I find distinct pleasure in creating. "What are my skills?". Why, I can form legible sentences, create websites, and design various programs. I am capable of enunciating, turning oxygen into carbon dioxide, and affecting my environment in both favorable or unpleasant ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Though, as far as I can perceive, every other human is just as capable of these things, if not more. Some are not as interested as I am in the sociological implications of virtual constructs on our shared reality and some are not nearly as fascinated or disgusted as I am by my perceived reality but they all have something they are intrigued by. If interest is what drives a human to act then surely a human as absorbed as I am by networking computers together is just as able as I am to do so. My actions do not appear to be remotely distinct and I do not seem special.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;"Although," I hurriedly quip to myself, "your experiences are different, distinct, and exceptional." Which I immediatly find distasteful because the idea of being exclusive is problematic. While being something others are not may drastically change our society it also carries with it a hollow sort of importance. Being "different" was something I gave high priority to when I was attending highschool but now it seems to be a method of garnering attention. After all, that is what I used it for in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;While attention is not something to be avoided I find that it now bothers me more than ever before. I am not fond of being seen, spoken to, or touched. "I do not deserve attention," my ardently stupid brain insists before I begin to dissaude it with various arguments for my self worth. Of course, I do know that being noticed will help me sustain myself and I do know that humans have gotten by for thousands of years through interaction. I also am aware that my "worth" is not entirely connected, but also not disconnected, from the amount of attention I may or may not receive.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of worrying, or maybe as an attempt to stop thinking so much, I find myself more invested in what I can do to affect my environment. If I keep reading more, learning more, or doing more I will be whatever I want to be. It is not so much a matter of what I am as much as what I will be. If I make certain choices right now I can affect the outcome of this entire rumination through my thoughts. I could go back and change a paragraph in such a way that it completely reflects a different portion of my thoughts. I could write that "Although being 'different' seems to convey a false sense of importance it still is important." Which I can assure you I do believe.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless, I still do not know what I want to be. There are so many things I could be that I feel overwhelmed by possibility. While I know plenty about computers I find myself intrigued by sociology, fascinated by psychology, and amazed at what chemistry, physics, and science in general are capable of. I want to play with everything that exists in this reality but it would appear that I only have so much time alloted to me to experience them. "What am I?". "What will I be?". "Where am I going?". I do not know the answers to these questions, but I intend to find out.

						There has been a bit of silence on my part lately. Many sleepless nights. Lots of them whiled away in front of a computer screen in a cluttered room, filling my brain with Javascript. While I have not produced anything of particular notice yet, I have a whirlwind of ideas assaulting me as I sleep. I have not had this much fun since I started learning C++.
					</p>
					<p>
						I intend to use this newfound knowledge to finish <i><a class="aLink" href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=34866">Deeper</a></i>. While <a class="aLink" href="http://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine</a> is a great tool, I enjoy programming something from nothing. I have found that constantly working, learning, and solving something fuels me and makes me happy.

			<!--LUDUM DARE 29: POST-MORTEM -- --/--/14-->
			<div class="post">
				<span class="title">Ludum Dare 29: Post-Mortem</span><br><span class="titleTime">05/01/14</span><hr>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						<a class="aLink" href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/04/23/welcome-to-ludum-dare-29er/" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a> is over and with it many hopes and dreams have become a reality, mine included. While Ludum Dare was not as successful for me as I had hoped it would be I have learned a lot. Along with the knowledge I aquired I have gained a large amount of hope. The community surrounding Ludum Dare is dazzlingly compassionate.
					</p>
					<p>
						To cover the blanks from my last post to this, I finally decided on a method of incorporating "Beneath the Surface" as a theme into my game. I decided to incorporate it as a metaphysical concept of the reality surrounding the player. In other words, I wanted the player to be able to interact with their enviroment at an incredibly deep level. If they wanted to interact with the atoms composing the chair they start on in the game then I wanted to make it so. Of course, that ended up being a bit of a grandiose idea for a game that needed to be made within seventy-two hours, but I fool-heartedly pressed on.
					</p>
					<p>
						It took me some time, but I finally decided to use <a class="aLink" href="http://twinery.org" target="_blank">Twine</a> and <a class="aLink" href="http://www.sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime</a> as my IDE. I already use Sublime when working on this website and I am very familiar with HTML so I assumed that Twine would not be too much of a problem. Unfortunately, each IDE has its own quirks and Twine was no exception. Sometimes when designing a stylesheet for a particular page the use of "!important" was necessary to override bits that Twine was writing to the final HTML file. For clarification, "!important" is suppose to make that specific line of code take precedence over any other line of code that contradicts it at a later point. It could be viewed as poor coding practice, but was necessary for what I was doing. Unfortunately, Twine still managed to squash my efforts and render some of my ideas and stylesheets useless till I could find a workaround.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the end, I did not manage to finish my game before the deadline. While that was a crushing blow I submitted my game anyway. Even in its unfinished state I have managed to get some positive feedback. On that note, what I find fascinating is that I have yet to see anyone ridicule someone else during or after the jam. The community somehow manages to keep a very positive attitude. Each failure is treated as a small triumph, because from that failure sprouts knowledge and experience. I find that endearing and rewarding.
					</p>
					<p>
						I intend to take this experience and use it to fuel more study, more games, and hopefully more fun. I know that in future jams I am going to choose my IDE and various other feautures before the jam even begins. It will be dependent on what I am comfortable with, of course. Which will rely on me having used my tools on a more regular basis. These are all things I will do and am doing now. I think I will use Twine more, try to get more familiar with JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and maybe even Java. I also think returning to C++ would be great, as I had studied that extensively back in college. Whatever I do, I think I will just try to do what suits me best and attempt to smile more.

			<!--IT BEGINS: LUDUM DARE 29 -- 04/25/2014-->
			<div class="post">
				<span class="title">It Begins: Ludum Dare 29</span><br><span class="titleTime">04/25/14</span><hr>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						<a class="aLink" href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/04/23/welcome-to-ludum-dare-29er/" target="_blank">Ludum Dare 29</a> is upon us! The theme is "Beneath the Surface". It is not what I was expecting, but honestly, I am having some difficulty recalling the other themes and what I actually was expcting. Maybe something along the lines of "You Are the Enemy"? Regardless, the waiting is over! I am totally ready to start! I am going to make this as brief of a post as possible, but I am hoping that writing out my plans will help some as a form of self-dictation. Like <a class="aLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging" target="_blank">rubber duck debugging</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have a few ideas already that I have been thinking of incorporating into the theme. That was before the theme was released, of course. Quickly listing the ideas, I was thinking of an interpretation of <a class="aLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus" target="_blank">Sisyphus</a> and the current philosophy of AAA games making <a class="aLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber" target="_blank">skinner boxes</a>. I also wanted to do something with timed dialogue events. Similar to TellTale Games' <i><a class="aLink" href="https://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead/" target="_blank">The Walking Dead</i></a> and Anna Anthropy's <i><a class="aLink" href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/" target="_blank">Queers in Love at The End of The World</i></a>. I am not really sure how I am going to incorporate those, if at all, into the theme of "Beneath the Surface", though.
					</p>
					<p>
						Focusing on something other than what I will actually make, beginning with tools, after seeing a tweet by <a class="aLink" href="https://twitter.com/lexaloffle" target="_blank">@lexaloffle</a> about <a class="aLink" href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/voxatron.php" target="_blank">Voxatron</a> being available to use for content creation, I am really interested in designing something that might utilize that. I really like voxels, but do not have much experience working with them. So I might lean more towards <a class="aLink" href="http://slick.ninjacave.com/" target="_blank">Slick2D</a> or maybe even <a class="aLink" href="http://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine</a>. It really depends on what I am going to do! This is a slow beginning! I know I am going to use <a class="aLink" href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html" target="_blank">sfxr</a> and <a class="aLink" href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/boscaceoil/" target="_blank">bosca ceoil</a> for sounds, though.
					</p>
					<p>
						What comes to mind first, is the entity that lurks beneath the surface of all of us. Another way to look at it would be to think of the 'mask' that we all wear. It changes depending on circumstance. It is not something bad, we do interact differently in differing situations for good reasons. It also can be for bad reasons. Of course, I want to focus on those bad reasons! Drug abuse, marital infidelity, demons that use humans to get what they desire, leviathan! Now there are a lot of ideas jumbled up in my head. I may do some storyboarding or drawing, rather. I like to connect concepts together to see where they will go. What I think would be most fun of all, though, would be to take one simple concept, like <a class="aLink" href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/" target="_blank">VVVVVV</a> did and making something completely based off that.
					</p>
					<p>
						I will post updates as they happen, but I am also going to be posting various updates on <a class="aLink" href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/" target="_blank">http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/</a> so information may be sparse until the jam is over. Oh! I forgot to mention that I will be focusing on the jam and not the compo. I do not think I am ready to submit to the compo. Maybe next Ludum Dare!

			<!--SHAME -- 04/24/2014-->
			<div class="post">
				<span class="title">Shame</span><br><span class="titleTime">04/24/14</span><hr>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						As I noted in my previous post, I have been working on this post for over a month now. There have been various reasons for my lack of persistence in getting this post done, but mostly I have been ashamed of making such a self-indulgent and personal post. For the past month I have only managed to quit my dayjob of selling various electronics to people that do not need them and made small progress in not committing suicide. With the worst of my latest downward swing in mood behind me I will once again be able to focus on the things I do want to do with this life of mine.
					</p>
					<p>
						While I lack a form of income currently, I am equipped enough to eat, sleep, and live where I am for a short while. In the meantime, I have been situating myself back in our agreed upon reality, attempting to make changes to the way I interact with reality and others within it, and watching Ludum Dare 29 with eager eyes. I have entered Ludum Dare 29 and while I do not think I will garner much notice, I am looking forward to designing something fun. I have not coded a game in years, unfortunately, and I hope this will be a small way to reconcile that. After Ludum Dare, focus will return to bettering myself, possibly moving, and finding another way of sustaining myself for a longer period of time than I am able to at the moment. What follows from here is my original post on shame. I cannot bring myself to edit, change, and modify it anymore than necessary for accessibility. For that I apologize. It may be vulgar, it may be indulgent, it may even be bitter and vile, but it is me.
					</p>
					<p>
						Shame is something that I have let rule my life for a very long time and that I know I have dealt with poorly. It has been something I probably could have talked about before now, but did not, because I have been ashamed about feeling shame. I have been afraid to express myself fully and voice my opinions whether they are more likened to frustration, elation, or just plain fear. This is because of an undeserved fear that there would be serious repercussions for expressing these feelings. What is a small amount of criticism for many becomes, for me, an inner turmoil for hours or even days after incident. Often, I preemptively criticize myself before a conversation or meeting even occurs. This deeply ingrained and uncomfortable anxiety is difficult to discuss with anyone. If I do let others(usually a friend) know I feel agitated in their prescence or unable to speak my thoughts fully I am often met with skepticism or superficial understanding.
					</p>
					<p>
						Those that are skeptical quickly push my concerns away making comments suggesting that my stress is non-existant or merely something we all feel. In that manner, they continue, it's not a problem or something that warrants discussion. Despite my internal frustrations with being unable to express myself and a distinct feeling of being an outsider, I carry on as expected to by said individual or group. In the case of those that tell me they understand I often find that they are only willing to be empathetic for a limited amount of time. They will usually attempt to make concessions, which I fail to admit I feel underserving of, as I usually brought up the matter to simply explain my inclinations to not be sociable. After a few conversations or meetings, during which they may try to remind me to relax but result in me becoming overwhlemed, they quickly turn cynical. They begin to express frustration and stop any attempts at patience, leaving me where I was before I brought up the problem, only slightly more guilty and frustrated. Over the course of years this problem has cost me a considerable number of friends and family as I have begun to withdraw from contact altogether.
					</p>
					<p>
						By hiding how nervous and uncomfortable I am around others, covering up any self-abuse, and not discussing my feelings, I find myself further removed from those that probably consider or want to consider me a friend. I lose my sense of self and just start going through the motions while trying to come up with reasons to keep doing so. Finding something to commit myself to helps. It is distracting from my inner concerns and gives me a sense of realism. I find myself thinking that, somehow, these actions I am commiting actually have a discernible and unique effect. In contrast, I often find that the things I did as a form of income, before this month, had an immense lack of consequence. I sold products on a large company's behalf and in no way benefited or produced anything from it other than monetary gain and experience in lying well. To be able to do something that is important to me and that is tangible, in the sense that it can be seen, is not something I take lightly. Seeing my actions have a small form of meaning is somewhat inspiring. Even in my darkest moments I can recall that I have designed something. I have <i>done something</i>, albeit small. Even if my actions go unnoticed or sink away into the deepest depths of the internet and human memory, I still existed as I wanted to, for just a moment.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nevertheless, on those days that I find myself consumed by self-loathing and despair, the insight that I have <i>done something</i> is of little relief. I will come up with arguments about my worthlessness, recall numerous regrets, and be ashamed about my inability to express myself fully amongst others when in conversation. Drugs have made a regular appearance in these times, further deepening the various lies I will need to tell about any disappaerances, meetings, or hangouts I may have missed. Not only do they interrupt what little of a life I currently have, but they also have various downsides in recurring withdrawals and addictions. When I wrote about being a 'drunk little shit' yesterday, I was hardly covering the problems with escapism I have had for years now.
					</p>
					<p>
						I write about this at such length because I am tired of running away. The things I want to escape from have been doing well at keeping up with me. Leaving my family behind and not dealing with their immense and religious-based dislike of me being a pansexual human who does not know what gender role it fits into has caused no end of grief as they continually attempt to contact me, oddly enough, and I continually try to further escape them. Not working on my communication skills along with a large amount of anxiety has not made anything better, obviously. Not admitting to myself that I have depression has made it swell with vigor. Keeping secret my weaknesses and downfalls from even myself has simply made me weaker.
					</p>
					<p>
						By writing about my anxiety and shame I am providing myself with acknowledgement. I have my own distinct problems. Realizing what they are, working on them, and using them, instead of as weaknesses but as strengths, I will become a better me.
					</p>
					<p class="note">
						As an addendum, I would like to draw your attention to <span class="aLink"><a href="http://snapdraws.tumblr.com/post/50082858616/apologies-for-the-terrible-image-quality-im" target="_blank">this</a></span> post by Sophie Wright on Tumblr, as it often was something to rely on to better shape my words and self-criticism.

			<!--DRUNK LITTLE SHIT -- 04/23/2014-->

			<div class="post">
				<span class="title">Drunk Little Shit</span><br><span class="titleTime">04/23/14</span><hr>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						I am still the same as I was in highschool. A drunk little shit who thinks he/she/it is too good for everyone. A procrastinator. An asshole. A person that needs alcohol to make a post like this. A person who can't even make a post about shame for over a month, no matter how many times they look at it, work on it, and change it.
					</p>
					<p>
						I could reflect on the fact that even when drunk I can make blog posts that are readable, in HTML, but that's ridiculous. It's not of any skill to be able to post something in a template that was written earlier. I could reflect on my friends and family, of which I really have none. Those I had in the past are gone and those I have currently are just as hopelessly afloat as I am. I could post that stupid post about being ashamed of myself, everything I do, and everything I ever hope to do, but it's a ridiculous post, lamenting that I am a jerk who needs to be reminded he is appreciated on a regular basis.
					</p>
					<p>
						I could shoot myself. I would have to go and buy a firearm then, but is that all it takes? Is it really that easy? That is such a small investment for the end of one's life. This is ridiculous. I make everything bigger than it is. Dramatize it. Like a school production or english teacher fawning over a particular book or novel in an effort to grab the attention of various students.
					</p>
					<p>
						I feel like I have not changed. I still hate myself for caring so much. I still hate this reality I inhabit. I still hate people for what could only be briefly described as being human. I still hate myself for not feeling human. I hate myself for creating my own terrors and depression.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ugh. I have hurt and destroyed myself enough. I will try to get things done and turn myself around. Again.

						If you have not yet played Anna Anthropy's <span class="aLink"><i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/" target="_blank">Queers in Love at The End of The World</span></i></a>, then I suggest you do so now before continuing to read. Play it a few times, as only so much can be gleaned from quick, ten-second intervals of gameplay. Certainly, playing it once will be intriguing enough to keep you enthralled for a few fast-paced moments as you try to make the 'end of the world' worth something. If playing a quick game that will take up ten seconds of your time and offer an interesting perspective on decision-making does not interest you then please read on. before you do, though, please consider that even glancing at all these jumbled words will take longer than simply playing the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, <i>Queers in Love at The End of The World</i> is comprised entirely of dramatic text and a ten-second timer that ticks down rapidly. Choices are made by clicking on blue text that resembles actions. It may appear simple but manages to encapsulate the essence of being in love in a manner that many longer, more drawn out games will fail to deliver. Each action and choice has much more weight to it by forcing the player to make multiple decisions within a time limit. You may find yourself playing the game multiple times, quickly spending more than a mere ten seconds trying to comprehend not only the deeply emotional sentences that appear on the screen with each frantic click, but the emptiness those sentences will incite when the end arrives.

						Before things fall apart and fade from the screen, each tastefully revealing click is entirely dependent on where the player wants to go and what they want to accomplish. I found myself quickly scanning and muttering the words as my partner waited for me to acknowledge them in a way that would not actually mean anything when everything is wiped away. Which is an odd feeling, since the relationship isn't actually defined. There are very few specific details about the relationship that you share with this significant other, but by keeping specifics to a minimum and employing a text-only tale the player is able to better imagine their interpretation of a loved one.

						Despite there being no graphic representation of the deep ardour being displayed on screen the way wording is employed makes the game play heartwrenchingly well, leaving the detail to the player as they may recollect their own relationships or idealistic ideas of intimacy. No matter what choices are made, though, it will all come to an abrupt end in a fairly quick and almost quiet manner. The game is sad in the way that it makes each moment more tangible than the last in a desperate attempt to make some action be noteworthy. By making each choice such an important factor to the mere ten seconds you have to play, each decision has a particular weight and complexity that is then rendered useless when the end arrives. It is a very interesting design i would love to see explored in more detail.

						While ruminating on the idea that we may need more games with a timed dialogue mechanic in them, I will again suggest that at this point you go ahead and try <span class="aLink"><i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/" target="_blank">Queers in Love at The End of The World</span></i></a>. If I have not yet convinced you to at least try the game then I could resort to begging. Please try it. Preferably alone, comfortably, with a cup of wine and a morbid mood. You will not regret it.

						Having just barely finished what could be described as a webpage I am delighted to find that I now have a space to post my various thoughts and ramblings. They occur at irregular intervals, inviting intensive thinking and keeping me throughly distracted from things others may consider more important. I expect much of the content I spatter across this area will be wrought heavily with criticism and wonder.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;I am a girl.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm biting my lip in private anguish after typing that sentence. Consider the implications. The ways in which a person could adamantly attempt to refute that single statement scare me and stress me out. It makes me not want to continue writing or talking about the subject.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;All I want to do is simply express how I feel. I feel like a girl. I wish I was in a girl's body. I wish I had a girl's hair, skin, and shape. I'm even jealous when I see my friends comfortably wearing what is often considered 'girl clothing'. I want that. I want it so bad that I daydream about it. Some days I'll while away precious hours saving various pictures of girls wearing clothing or makeup that I want. Is that creepy? Please don't let it be weird. I've kept this hidden away for so long.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;I think I've really wanted to be a girl for a long time. In fact, if certain pyschiatric friends are correct, I have the brain of a girl which could be evidenced by various scans. While I cannot attest to the validity of that I do recall watching television shows like <a class="aLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa_Explains_It_All" target="_blank">Clarissa Explains It All</a> and <a class="aLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_World_of_Alex_Mack" target="_blank">The Secret World of Alex Mack</a> and being absolutely fascinated with the main characters in those shows. I wanted to be them. No, not because they were popular, had privilege, or special abilities. I wanted to be them because they had some of the coolest clothing and they had incredible amounts of agency. They made being a girl awesome and desirable. Sure, the acting may have been subpar and the stories may have completely ignored the unfortunate disadvantages women experience in various patriarchial societies but I was a child and none of that mattered to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;All I cared about was being able to wear such colourful and exciting clothing as Clarissa Darling. Maybe, if I was lucky I could even wake up and be her. If I pretended and thought about it enough, I'd transform into her, right? Imagination aside, I always found it extremely unfortunate that I was limited to the clothing of the average american male. Being told that I was choosing a shoe, shirt, or glasses frame designed for girls and that I was to choose something else was always disheartening. The uninspired colours and styles of the male did not fascinate me nearly as much as the dress, hair styles, nail polish, makeup, and awesomeness of all the females I saw around me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even during my years as a pubescent child I eventually focused on what it would be like to be a girl. What would it be like to be made love to as a girl? How would it feel? These thoughts and more racked my young brain as I fantasized about being the opposite gender sexually. It was something I was afraid to talk about. Despite wishing I could experience all those sensations and being fairly certain I'd be happier in a body like that I simply kept it to my imagination. Eventually I'd discover strange stories online about transforming into a girl, but it never occurred to me this was possible to do in reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;After years of internalizing my femininity and realizing that those choices wern't available to me I went into an odd sort of "goth" phase. It gave me an interesting sort of opportunity to wear makeup and paint my nails. It also allowed for some interesting style choices that under normal circumstances I never thought I'd be able to ask for from my parents. While I quietly accepted those less than hilarious "witty remark here" shirts, what I secretly admired and really desired were the arm socks, skirts, and red on black leggings of a classmate. Cross-dressing privately and slipping into bed at night wearing my sister's stolen clothing just wasn't the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;After my "goth" phase I met a lovely woman that accepted some of my odd quirks. While that helped me explore more effeminate clothing, which helped me get mistaken for a girl once or twice, I still felt that becoming a woman was an impossibility. Cross-dressing proved disappointing as I became broader and larger. It just wasn't right. It didn't feel good. I hated how makeup looked on me. Nail polish was disappointing as I decided my large masculine hands were unbecoming of such pleasing colors. How could this vessel that carries me ever become what I envisioned? Attempting to ignore those inner qualms I wore particularly cute and sometimes somewhat questionable clothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, I realized that I've been letting this affect my health. A few years ago I promptly left my father's home after coming out as pansexual to my family was not well received. With that impromptu decision and more I've been in a state of inner despair for a while. Sometimes I don't even sleep for days. Other days I skip eating or apply some other form of abuse to myself. When I've worn myself out completely I sleep entire days away before waking up and quickly reprimanding myself for resting. This cycle of self-destruction once got to the point that I eventually quit one of my jobs. Not because I wasn't performing well, no, not at all. I'm a workaholic. I just couldn't convince myself that my reality was meaningful so I was trapped in a weird state of heightened existential terror for a week. Someday, I hope to develop the courage to talk to someone about it and maybe get some therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;For the moment, though, simply writing about this issue is stressful. It doesn't even feel right to claim I'm a girl when I'm in a body like this. "It's wrong. I'm wrong. I'm sick, even." Those thoughts and more spin around in my head as I hide away inside myself, a monster pretending to be human. "Use 'they' pronouns with me", I proclaim profusely, wishing I could ask everyone to use 'she' or that the language I'm speaking didn't concern itself with such pronouns. Feeling disgusting and reviled I burrow deeper inside myself, not revealing my secret. "Seeking therapy or taking various drugs are things I'm not worthy of doing,"" I think to myself, while wishing that someone would stand up for me because I won't. "Maybe, if I keep staying alive I'll achieve my dreams," I whisper to myself, as I crawl from bed feeling unrested. I can't sleep when deep inside I'm a spoiled black brat that is rotting and begging for release. With each passing moment she clamours against my fleshy exterior while growing darker, angrier, and more neurotic.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to let her out. She's tearing me apart.

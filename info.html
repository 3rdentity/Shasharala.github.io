        REALITY
      </div>
      <p>
        Somewhere in someone's idea of space and time I am Ryan Combes, a front-end, back-end, all-end web developer also known as shasharala. I tend to fiddle with various bits and pieces of script, code, crazy ideas, and games. Coming up with solutions to various computing device problems helps me breathe, eat, and sleep easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am completely available to design, maintain, fix, or pretend to stare at and worry over any servers, websites, or systems. I will even move myself to specific locations in our agreed upon reality to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        I cannot resist a puzzle. If you seek to motivate me I would suggest breaking something in some intricate manner. Even if it is as mangled as PHP I will be consumed by a feverish desire to fix it.

      <p>
        This entire website is part of an ongoing attempt to teach myself web development. I started with HTML and CSS (as would be expected, I imagine) before learning Javascript. After playing with JS for a while I started making some (incomplete) games while getting really excited for ECMAScript 6. Currently, I am building a small database (for practice) with a LAMP stack but I am impatient to finish it and toy with the MEAN stack.

        The college I last attended saw fit to give me two AA degrees upon my graduation. I have one in Natural Science and another in Liberal Arts. They have served the purpose of carefully filling up my r&eacute;sum&eacute; with information that makes me look smart, dedicated, and slightly silly since I have not yet gotten a Bachelor's degree in some subject or other.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have some experience with doing things I would rather not in order to continue feeding, housing, and generally taking care of myself. The last job I had was working for an electronic merchandise reseller in a call center. I would regularly and precisely assist (convince) customers that their needs (desires) were more than taken care of. I was very good at it and on my way to being a supervisor, manager or something.
      </p>

        If you are interested in a more standard r&eacute;sum&eacute; I have one available in <a href="http://shasharala.net/res/info/Resume_RyanCombes.odt" target="_blank" draggable="false">ODF</a> or <a href="http://shasharala.net/res/info/Resume_RyanCombes.pdf" target="_blank" draggable="false">PDF</a>.

        DREAMS
      </div>
      <p>
        The starry-eyed stares of those that are engrossed in their passions are absolutely wonderful. Working (playing?) hard they cultivate that which they love. Sometimes they come back with tales and treasures of that which they have created or partaken in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I will beguile myself into staring at the computer for hours on end, whiling away my time trying to figure out something that I assume must be simple to someone else somewhere. I wonder if my concentrated and possibly unnerving focus is as awe inducing as those that come back with something tangible. I will working until I make something.

        Make-Believe
      </div>
      <p>
        I make things. When I am not studying, reading, thinking, relaxing, or doing a myriad of things that I will not mention here, I am fiddling about trying to break or test something I have only just learned about. So far I've only produced a handful of small tests in regards to <a href="http://shasharala.net/games.html" target="_blank" draggable="false">game development</a>, <a href="http://main.shasharala.net" target="_blank" draggable="false">servers</a>, images, and other computer related material.

        The Future
      </div>
      <p>
        I want to study all sorts of computer related languages. C++ (again), Java, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby/Rails... The list does not end there, as with each language comes various libraries and opportunities to interact with prior learned languages. It is going to be a lot of work. I know it will be fun too, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultures fascinate me. Particularly when they are not born out of Western ideology's advancement across the land. I would love to (and plan to) go to countries like Bhutan, Japan, China, India, and more. Please imagine my eyes getting slightly glazed over as you read about my adoration for differing philosophies/lifestyles. There is an entire planet out there to explore and here I sit day after day typing away instructions for machines to follow. While computers are amusing and powerful objects I have this burning yearning to drift.

						i was thinking about the way choices are handled in anna anthropy's <i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">queers in love at the end of the world</i></a> and the way in which many contemporary games do not employ a time limit on the choices that a player makes, which may have the effect of making choices seem arbitrary. many games insist that the player is a hero and the world will fall apart without them. ignoring for a moment the idea that reality as is constructed in each game's little world would disintegrate if one person with enough brains to do something about anything did nothing, let's focus on the player being offered an infinite amount of time to pursue all the goals the game gives them.

			<!--SHAME -- 04/23/2014-->
			<!--<div class="post">
				<span class="title">Shame</span><br><span class="titleTime">04/23/14</span><hr>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I noted in my previous post, I have been working on this post for over a month now. There have been various reasons for my lack of persistence in getting this post done, suchashamed of posting such a self-indulgent post.

						Shame is something that has been effectively ruling my life for a very long time and that I know I have dealt with poorly. It has been something I probably could have talked about before now, but did not, because I have been ashamed about feeling shame. I have been afraid to express myself fully and voice my opinions whether they are more likened to frustration, elation, or just plain fear out of the fear that there would be serious repercussions for expressing these feelings. What is a small amount of criticism for many becomes an inner turmoil for hours or even days after incident. This deeply ingrained and uncomfortable anxiety is difficult to discuss. When letting others know I feel agitated in their prescence or unable to speak my thoughts fully I am often met with skepticism or superficial understanding.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those that are skeptical quickly push my concerns and effectively me away from their thinking space. They will make comments suggesting that my stress is non-existant or merely something we all feel. In that manner, they continue, it's not a problem or something that warrants discussion. I then feel a sharp sense of regret for bringing the subject up and, despite my internal frustrations with being unable to express myself, I carry on as expected to. In the case of those that tell me they understand I often find that they are only willing to be empathetic for a limited amount of time. After I let them know I am an extremely agitated person inside they attempt to make concessions, which I fail to admit I feel underserving of. Unfortunately, this does not last very long, as after a few conversations or meetings, they quickly turn cynical. They begin to express frustration and stop any attempts at patience, leaving me where I was before I brought up the problem, only slightly more guilty and frustrated. It has lost me a considerable number of friends and family as I have begun to withdraw from contact altogether.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By hiding how nervous and uncomfortable I am around, covering up any self-abuse, and hiding that I really have to put a great amount of effort into getting out of bed every day, I find myself further removed from those that probably consider me a great friend. I lose my sense of self and just start going through the motions while trying to come up with reasons to keep doing so. It is frightening to express myself. It has gotten to the point that even starting this post has taken days of me procrastinating and writing many different drafts because I am scared of expressing myself on my own website. I worry about a backlash from both seen and unseen antagonists. In the past when expressing myself on popular websites like Myspace or Facebook I was met with a great deal of hatred and cynicism from friends and family. When I decided to try to stop worrying and express myself freely on Facebook my family quickly attacked me when they discovered that I was pansexual. Certainly, I could have handled my response better or told them before making many allusions to it on my pages but I digress. Regardless of past experiences, I feel that if I have a space to express myself in, that I am in full control of, I might be able to overcome some of my anxiety. Along with this website I have been trying to do things that will affect my personal sense of worth.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding something to commit myself to helps. It is distracting from my inner concerns and gives me a sense of realism. I find myself thinking that, somehow, these actions I am commiting actually have a discernible and unique effect. In contrast, I often find that the things I do at work have an immense lack of consequence. I sell products on a large company's behalf and in no way benefit or produce anything from it other than in monetary gain and experience. To be able to do something that is important to me and that is tangible, in the sense that it can be seen, is not something I take lightly. Seeing my actions have a small form of meaning is somewhat inspiring. Even in my darkest moments I can recall that I have designed something. I have <i>done something</i>, albeit small. Even if my actions go unnoticed or sink away into the deepest depths of the internet and human memory, I still existed as I wanted to, for just a moment.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, on those days that I find myself consumed by self-loathing and despair, the insight that I have <i>done something</i> is of little relief. I will come up with arguments about my worthlessness, recall numerous regrets, and be ashamed about my inability to express myself fully amongst others when in conversation. When feeling like this I will often find myself staying silent or in some scenarios talking low, quietly, somehow hoping that others will mistake what I said for what they wanted to hear till their attention is eventually diverted elsewhere. Then I make my escape, feeling horribly awkward. I will find myself wanting to seamlessly disappear without notice or care and I will not feel worth the notice that may be afforded my disappearance.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these moments of self-torture my sense of worth will be deeply affected by my sense of shame. I feel unimportant, deaf to the sounds of those I know would try to claim otherwise. That's why the projects I take on and create for myself consume me so much. I want something I can feel proud of. It is a similiar feeling to writing a r&eacute;sum&eacute; and finding oneself wishing they had a specific degree, certificate, or thing to reflect their skill and experience. While many accomplishments are made on a regular basis, they become unimpressive under a microscope of introspection. That in turn makes me want to work harder to improve myself, to feel better about myself, and to be more.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that cause me shame are mostly in the past or things I can do little about. By writing about them, expressing my frustrations over them, I want to address them

						I am ashamed of being autistic, rendering communication with others an odd sort of success that leaves me feeling empty. I am ashamed of being pansexual. Ashamed of being genderqueer. Ashamed of having let myself be used in sexual situations. Ashamed of running from my problems. I am ashamed of running from my family, fearing them, feeling subpar compared to them, and feeling rejected by them. I am ashamed of expressing my internal frustrations and self-loathing. I am ashamed of the lies I tell when I try to hide even the smallest of wrongdoings or try to hide the addictions, escapism, and self-destructive behavior I have engaged in in shame.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ashamed of this blog post and feel undeserving of any form of empathy/sympathy.

			<!--DRUNK LITTLE SHIT -- 04/23/2014-->

			<div class="post">
				<span class="title">Drunk Little Shit</span><br><span class="titleTime">04/23/14</span><hr>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still the same as I was in highschool. A drunk little shit who thinks he/she/it is too good for everyone. A procrastinator. An asshole. A person that needs alcohol to make a post like this. A person who can't even make a post about shame for over a month, no matter how many times they look at it, work on it, and change it.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could reflect on the fact that even when drunk I can make blog posts that are readable, in HTML, but that's ridiculous. It's not of any skill to be able to post something in a template that was written earlier. I could reflect on my friends and family, of which I really have none. Those I had in the past are gone and those I have currently are just as hopelessly afloat as I am. I could post that stupid post about being ashamed of myself, everything I do, and everything I ever hope to do, but it's a ridiculous post, lamenting that I am a jerk who needs to be reminded he is appreciated on a regular basis.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could shoot myself. I would have to go and buy a firearm then, but is that all it takes? Is it really that easy? That is such a small investment for the end of one's life. This is ridiculous. I make everything bigger than it is. Dramatize it. Like a school production or english teacher fawning over a particular book or novel in an effort to grab the attention of various students.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like I have not changed. I still hate myself for caring so much. I still hate this reality I inhabit. I still hate people for what could only be briefly described as being human. I still hate myself for not feeling human. I hate myself for creating my own terrors and depression.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ugh. I have hurt and destroyed myself enough. I will try to get things done and turn myself around. Again.

			<!--A QUEER END -- 03/18/2014-->
			<div class="post">
				<span class="title">A Queer End</span><br><span class="titleTime">03/18/14</span><hr>
				<div class="content">
					<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="resources/blog/endoftheworld.png" title="everything is wiped away in the end">
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have not yet played Anna Anthropy's <span class="aLink"><i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">Queers in Love at The End of The World</span></i></a>, then I suggest you do so now before continuing to read. Play it a few times, as only so much can be gleaned from quick, ten-second intervals of gameplay. Certainly, playing it once will be intriguing enough to keep you enthralled for a few fast-paced moments as you try to make the 'end of the world' worth something. If playing a quick game that will take up ten seconds of your time and offer an interesting perspective on decision-making does not interest you then please read on. before you do, though, please consider that even glancing at all these jumbled words will take longer than simply playing the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, <i>Queers in Love at The End of The World</i> is comprised entirely of dramatic text and a ten-second timer that ticks down rapidly. Choices are made by clicking on blue text that resembles actions. It may appear simple but manages to encapsulate the essence of being in love in a manner that many longer, more drawn out games will fail to deliver. Each action and choice has much more weight to it by forcing the player to make multiple decisions within a time limit. You may find yourself playing the game multiple times, quickly spending more than a mere ten seconds trying to comprehend not only the deeply emotional sentences that appear on the screen with each frantic click, but the emptiness those sentences will incite when the end arrives.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before things fall apart and fade from the screen, each tastefully revealing click is entirely dependent on where the player wants to go and what they want to accomplish. I found myself quickly scanning and muttering the words as my partner waited for me to acknowledge them in a way that would not actually mean anything when everything is wiped away. Which is an odd feeling, since the relationship isn't actually defined. There are very few specific details about the relationship that you share with this significant other, but by keeping specifics to a minimum and employing a text-only tale the player is able to better imagine their interpretation of a loved one.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite there being no graphic representation of the deep ardour being displayed on screen the way wording is employed makes the game play heartwrenchingly well, leaving the detail to the player as they may recollect their own relationships or idealistic ideas of intimacy. No matter what choices are made, though, it will all come to an abrupt end in a fairly quick and almost quiet manner. The game is sad in the way that it makes each moment more tangible than the last in a desperate attempt to make some action be noteworthy. By making each choice such an important factor to the mere ten seconds you have to play, each decision has a particular weight and complexity that is then rendered useless when the end arrives. It is a very interesting design i would love to see explored in more detail.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ruminating on the idea that we may need more games with a timed dialogue mechanic in them, I will again suggest that at this point you go ahead and try <span class="aLink"><i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">Queers in Love at The End of The World</span></i></a>. If I have not yet convinced you to at least try the game then I could resort to begging. Please try it. Preferably alone, comfortably, with a cup of wine and a morbid mood. You will not regret it.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having just barely finished what could be described as a webpage I am delighted to find that I now have a space to post my various thoughts and ramblings. They occur at irregular intervals, inviting intensive thinking and keeping me throughly distracted from things others may consider more important. I expect much of the content I spatter across this area will be wrought heavily with criticism and wonder.

GAME IDEA:
A tongue-in-cheek game that requires the player to make a password that matches more and more absurd requirements.

As play continues the game will request more characters, more uppercase characters, more lowercase characters, more symbols, and more numbers.
Complications may involve a requirement for no repeating characters (in a row or ever), any numbers needing to add up to a specific value, and maybe that no set of 2 characters can repeat.

Setting a time limit in the form of a periodically resetting "captcha" may further raise the difficulty.
Setting the game so that copy+paste cannot be done may be benificial.
Setting the game so that puzzles are randomly generated may be beneficial.

- caps lock warning
- actual levels/parsing
- a correct interface
- when incorrect set value in dataEntry to empty and then remove incorrect as typing starts
    OR when incorrect leave value in dataEntry alone and remove incorrect when backspace or typing starts
- change wording of legend to tell player what rules they have broken, if any (one word puzzle has no rules)

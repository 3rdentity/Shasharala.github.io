						shame rules a large majority of my life. i was shamed by myu family, i felt shame with my friends and did not speak to them or see them. i felt shame in getting my jobs and in myself. i even felt shame in those i dated. it turned me into a closet geek. it made me scared to see people, to be judged. i have been dealing with it for a very long time but I think it's time to take care of it and talk about it.

						i was thinking about the way choices are handled in anna anthropy's <i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">queers in love at the end of the world</i></a> and the way in which many contemporary games do not employ a time limit on the choices that a player makes, which may have the effect of making choices seem arbitrary. many games insist that the player is a hero and the world will fall apart without them. ignoring for a moment the idea that reality as is constructed in each game's little world would disintegrate if one person with enough brains to do something about anything did nothing, let's focus on the player being offered an infinite amount of time to pursue all the goals the game gives them.

			<!--A QUEER END -- 03/18/2014-->
			<div class="post">

					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you have not yet played anna anthropy's <i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">queers in love at the end of the world</i></a>, then i suggest you do so now before continuing to read. play it a few times, as only so much can be gleaned from quick, ten-second intervals of gameplay. certainly, playing it once will be intriguing enough to keep you enthralled for a few fast-paced moments as you try to make the 'end of the world' worth something. if playing a quick game that will take up ten seconds of your time and offer an interesting perspective on decision-making does not interest you then please read on. before you do, though, please consider that even glancing at all these jumbled words will take longer than simply playing the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in short, <i>queers in love at the end of the world</i> is comprised entirely of dramatic text and a ten-second timer that ticks down rapidly. choices are made by clicking on blue text that resembles actions. it may appear simple but manages to encapsulate the essence of being in love in a manner that many longer, more drawn out games will fail to deliver. each action and choice has much more weight to it by forcing the player to make multiple decisions within a time limit. you may find yourself playing the game multiple times, quickly spending more than a mere ten seconds trying to comprehend not only the deeply emotional sentences that appear on the screen with each frantic click, but the emptiness those sentences will incite when the end arrives.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before things fall apart and fade from the screen, each tastefully revealing click is entirely dependent on where the player wants to go and what they want to accomplish. i found myself quickly scanning and muttering the words as my partner waited for me to acknowledge them in a way that would not actually mean anything when everything is wiped away. which is an odd feeling, since the relationship isn't actually defined. there are very few specific details about the relationship that you share with this significant other, but by keeping specifics to a minimum and employing a text-only tale the player is able to better imagine their interpretation of a loved one.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despite there being no graphic representation of the deep ardour being displayed on screen the way wording is employed makes the game play heartwrenchingly well, leaving the detail to the player as they may recollect their own relationships or idealistic ideas of intimacy. no matter what choices are made, though, it will all come to an abrupt end in a fairly quick and almost quiet manner. the game is sad in the way that it makes each moment more tangible than the last in a desperate attempt to make some action be noteworthy. by making each choice such an important factor to the mere ten seconds you have to play, each decision has a particular weight and complexity that is then rendered useless when the end arrives. it is a very interesting design i would love to see explored in more detail.
					</p>
					<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while ruminating on the idea that we may need more games with a timed dialogue mechanic in them, i will again suggest that at this point you go ahead and try <i><a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/endoftheworld/">queers in love at the end of the world</i></a>. if i have not yet convinced you to at least try the game then i could resort to begging. please try it. preferably alone, comfortably, with a cup of wine and a morbid mood. you will not regret it.

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having just barely finished what could be described as a webpage i am delighted to find that i now have a space to post my various thoughts and ramblings. they occur at irregular intervals, inviting intensive thinking and keeping me throughly distracted from things others may consider more important. i expect much of the content i spatter across this area will be wrought heavily with criticism and wonder.

TERMS OF USE

If something isn't covered in these terms and conditions about the material present on my website then please get permission from me before doing whatever it may be. It probably means I've simply forgotten to include it, but by no means does it mean I want you to do it. Keeping creative works open enough that others may enjoy them but secure enough that a creator is credited in a way they appreciate is tricky. I am going to try to keep things simple in an open, honest, and trusting manner 
with the hope that you will do the same in regard to me.
